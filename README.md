# Data Visualizations for the Tacoma Estimator

The Flask web framework was used to build the [homepage](https://github.com/krishnil/project) and
the Dash framework was used to build the visualizations page.

* The first scatter plot shows how the state, odometer and title status affect the price of the vehicle.
The size of the plot represents the odometer.
